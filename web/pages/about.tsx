        <h1>A new type of developer agency</h1>
        <p>We are a group of product and tech enthusiasts with a long background in both entrepreneurial, early-stage ventures and established companies like Klarna and Spotify.</p>
        
        <p>Our main objective is to help startups get off the ground by supporting them with product, software development and technical due-diligence.</p>
        
        <p>Think of us as interim CPO/CTO, being able to take your idea to an MVP and then help you hand-over, and possibly able to help you recruit, a full-time in-house team.</p>

        <p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@preparty.se">info@preparty.se</a> if you have an idea you want to pitch, or if you want to collaborate in other ways.</p>
